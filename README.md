# Animation Trove

Animation Trove is a project that showcases a collection of my favorite animations that I found while browsing the web. They are replicated using the [Framer Motion library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/framer-motion).

Check out the live demo of Animation Trove [here](https://animation-trove.vercel.app/).
